These tar files contain the necessary tabulated potential files to describe a coarse-grained (CG) model for sodium triflate dissolved in glyme solvents. 
Each tarball contains an example .lammps.data file for carrying out a CG simulation, an example .in file that shows you which tabulated files go with which CG partile interactions, and the set of 6 unique tabulated potentials to describe glyme-glyme, glyme-sodium, glyme-triflate, sodium-sodium, triflate-triflate, and sodium-triflate interactions.
Model 1.0 contains tabulated potentials derived from all atom radial distribution functions on diglyme with 2.0M sodium triflate with only the short-ranged tabulated interactions.
Model 2.0 contains tabulated potentials derived from all-atom radial distributions functions with added long-ranged electrostatics between the sodium and triflate.  This model was also trained on diglyme with 2.0M sodium triflate.
Model 3.0 is the same as Model 2.0, but trained on diglyme with 1.0M sodium triflate instead.
